Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?

string to byte[] array

ok i know this has been beat to death but i can't seam to get all the ones on google here or anyplace to work 
i have a string that looks like this
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

i store this string
each digit has a range from 0 to 254 and the string is almost random
i need to convert this to a byte array because of a hardware
change
this is what the hardware is looking for 
hardware.command(DeviceID, byte[]);

i tested the  hardware by doing this
hardware.command(1, new byte[] { 0, 0, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38,",204,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:1')",False

  ","Q:

Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?

Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters Close to Call Up?

It was only a matter of time before this topic was addressed by Dale Sveum and the Cubs front office given the roster turnover the last couple of days. Per Sveum it sounds like the organization will get together on Thursday to discuss the possibility of calling up both Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters this month. Sveum was clear in saying that if they did get called up they would play every day, which is awesome to hear.

...and she only became a BB contestant because of her associate with Giggs.

No she didn't but she wasn't very memorable as a BB contestant except for original siding with the resident bitch in the house that year - Grace double barrelled something and then crossing over to the other faction the moment she was kicked out - she might have a house romance too I really can't remember. She was Miss Wales in some capacity too before then.

Many situations exist where signal interference between multiple wireless devices degrades the performance of one or more of the devices, based on signal strengths and/or the physical proximity of the devices.
For example, in the home, signals from a microwave oven, cordless phone, and wireless access point often interfere with each other. Depending on the relative strengths of the signals (i.e., weaker signals introduce less interference) and/or physical separation between the devices (i.e., signals weaken as the distance between the devices increases), the interference results in a slow download, the inability to communicate with a Web server, or a “bad” phone connection (i.e., unable to clearly hear the other party).
In some situations, the interference may be of little consequence, though annoying to most users. However, there are situations, such as those dealing with the wireless communication devices used by public safety personnel, where the interference has potentially problematic consequences, particularly when working in a hazardous environment.
For example, a police officer typically uses a two-way radio for communicating with a dispatcher or other officers on the same digital radio frequency. These digital radio communications are subject to interference by other wireless devices (e.g., cell phones, vehicular subscriber modems, etc.) that operate on nearby spectrum blocks, when the officer is near to these wireless devices. In such a situation, the officer's time-sensitive communications may become unclear, completely garbled, or delayed.
Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.

Hello.

We are DWG consultants. We are a full service team of skilled engineers, qualified support staff (and some serious Batkid enthusiasts).

We are breaking free from the engineers stereotype. That's right, we pull out our USB drives without removing safely.

Don't react...listen.

Why do we call ourselves consultants? It's simple. An engineer responds to input from the client. But a consultant asks intelligent questions and draws upon a depth of professional experience to make decisions for the client – bringing answers and smart solutions to the table, not more questions.

We're people people. We thrive on communication and interaction, specifically those of the fun(ny) variety.

Theory of relational awesomeness between DWG and client.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

It's simple:love where you work.

We believe a team that has fun together works well together. And a team that works well together produces amazing work.

We foster collaboration and exploration through our use of cutting edge technology. We design using state of the art workstations and software, focused on Revit (and we play a mean game of Minesweeper).

Let's meet.

","Q:

Extending ActiveRecord::Base

I'm trying to add some custom methods to ActiveRecord. I want to add a *_after and *_before scopes for every date field of a model so I can do something like this:
User.created_at_after(DateTime.now - 3.days).created_at_before(DateTime.now)

I've followed the solution explained here Rails extending ActiveRecord::Base but when I execute the rails console and try to call the methods I get an undefined method error.
Here's my code:
# config/initializers/active_record_date_extension.rb
require ""active_record_date_extension""

# lib/active_record_date_extension.rb
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|
      if [""datetime"",""date""].include? column.type
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} >?"", date)
        end
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} <?"", date)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
Rails.application.eager_load!

ActiveRecord::Base.descendants.each do |model|
  model.send(:include, ActiveRecordDateExtension)
end

What am I doing wrong?

A:

Using Rails 4.1.9 and Ruby 2.2.1, I noticed a few issues with the code above.

You are comparing column.type with strings, and Rails returns symbols for that attribute.
base.define_method is trying to call a private method, you can get around that with send

This is the tweaked code
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|      
      if [:datetime, :date].include? column.type              
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} >?"", date)
        end
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} <?"", date)
        end

Petitioner further alleges that he suffered the residual effects of this injury for more than
six months. Petition at 4; Stipulation at ¶ 4. “Respondent denies that the flu vaccine
caused petitioner’s alleged left shoulder pain, or any other injury, and further denies that
his current disabilities are a sequela of a vaccine-related injury.” Stipulation at ¶ 6.

       Nevertheless, on August 7, 2017, the parties filed the attached joint stipulation,
stating that a decision should be entered awarding compensation. The undersigned

1
  Because this unpublished decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, the
undersigned intends to post it on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website, in accordance with

Electronic Government Services). In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days to
identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, the undersigned agrees that the identified material fits
within this definition, the undersigned will redact such material from public access.

Rajendra Agarwal (R), 53 years, Pune Income: Rs 5 lakh a year. Includes profit from business, house rent, capital gains and interest. Form used: ITR 4 for self, ITR 2 for parents and HUF. Our assessment: A knowledgeable taxpayer who understands the various deductions and tax-saving strategies, Agarwal is using the online facility to the hilt. All four returns are mailed to the Centralised Processing Centre in one envelope by speed post Ashwani Jain is feeling as if a load has been lifted off his shoulders.

Please find below the testimonials on our tax filing tool of last year. ""This was a breeze and fantastic. I hope all systems are made so easy and convenient so that everybody complies with their civic responsibilities. "" - C. Ramachandran (GM, Biomedical Engineering), CARE Convergence Center, Hyderabad ""I have used your tool and would like to say that it is finest online tool for preparing ITR for individuals...

It may be the beginning of the era of filing paperless returns - anytime and from any place. No longer is there a need to stand in long queues. Filing returns may become an easy and simple exercise. July 31 is the last date for filing income tax returns for individuals, Hindu Undivided Families, and other non-corporate assessees. Taxpayers have started preparing themselves for the yearly ritual of poring over their documents and making hurried calls to their chartered accountants. Though e-filing of returns is not compulsory for individual taxpayers, it has picked up in a big way because of the convenience it offers.

Never ask a man his wage and a woman her age is an adage often quoted but not one that your taxman upholds. Yet again, it's that time of the year when you are required to disclose the details of your income and file income-tax returns. To make this pocket-pinching process a non-taxing job, SundayET lists down six steps which you can follow to sail through. Do you need to pay tax? This year, the income-tax department has made revisions with regard to tax slabs and exemptions.

Discover how the Walters comes alive at night! Every Thursday from 5-9 p.m., you can wander the galleries, see special exhibitions for FREE, eat in our café and find the perfect gift at the museum store.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

The key word in the constitution is 'unreasonable'. To me, even the active pursuit of a drug user, using in his own home, outside the purview of public safety, is never reasonable. It goes beyond the role of peace officers. At the same time, i feel all drug use laws are on their face unconstitutional. The tenth amendment restricts federal power to those explicitly given in the constitution. All other powers are to be at the state level. If a state want's to make pot illegal, they can.. but it is unconstitutional for the federal government to do so.

Completely agree. As long as we are not directly harming someone else, what we do in the privacy of our own homes should not be allowed to attacked by government agents.

Victimless crimes is an oxymoron. These are laws that take away our freedoms, create criminals out of otherwise decent citizens and make it so that crime pays very well for those on the top of the criminal food chain. Prohibition proved what victimless laws do to enhance major crime elements. Remove the crime and you remove the criminal element and everyone except organized crime is better off.

...seek, and ye shall find;..

So always seek the Truth, not just what you want to believe to be true…

I think the Costitution was developed to protect the masses from intrusive AND abusive government. While it may appear to be a small thing to break in and stop drug dealers from destroying evidence, the bigger picture would be more like what ATF did in Waco Texas or at Ruby ridge. We have these protections for a reason. When we start to let the g-men slowly tighten their grubby hands around our neck when and where will it stop?

Search and rescue crews converge on the Grand Mesa, Saturday morning, but not because anyone was in danger or need of rescue, instead it was training for such instances.

They hike, ride, dive, and risk their own lives to save those in danger. Search and Rescue members say that one of the toughest parts of the job is the lack of predictability as each situation presents completely different obstacles.

Lieutenant Jim Fogg with the Mesa County Rural Area Program says ""You can have a situation that seems simple but it turns out to be complex or you can have a complex situation that turns out to be simple.""

So Search and Rescue team members must be prepared and trained for the many problems and obstacles at all times. The team members are training to respond to five different intensive scenarios, including a downed aircraft, a lost snow shoer, an avalanche, a water rescue, and an injured ice climber.

Still, no matter how rugged, cold, or wet the terrain, these men and women are dedicated to saving the lives of others at all costs.

Well I think Naruto fans got Kishi's hidden message in chapter 607 and are slowly losing interest. I wonder if Kishi really will be able to drag Naruto out for 1.5+ years now because Naruto's popularity is in a decline atm. It might end up below in Bleach in rankings soon.

Re: Weekly Shonen Jump [2012] - Discussion and TOC Talk - Part 4

It mentions in that ad that this is indeed the story Togashi wrote 10 years ago that never got made, and is the basis for the movie. The characters in there are the Kurta clan, and it basically gives Kurapika's origin story. It'll appear in two issues for a total of 63 pages. It's called the ""Kurapika Memory Arc"" (クラピカ追憶編). Doesn't mention anything about the series restarting.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

Aliya organization Nefesh B'Nefesh (NBN) officially opened the doors to its new Tel Aviv office on Monday, with an inauguration ceremony attended by the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv Yisrael Meir Lau.

The rabbi affixed a mezuza on the doorpost of the new office, located in the heart of Israel's cultural capital, on Rothschild Blvd.

NBN said it established its new Aliya center in response to a growing number of olim residing in the greater Tel Aviv area.

NBN's headquarters are in Jerusalem, and the organization also operates offices in Beersheba and Karmiel in addition to the NBN-Friends of the IDF Center for Lone Soldiers, which is also in Tel Aviv.

The new office will provide a wide range of aAliya services, as well as offering olim the opportunity to participate in hundreds of workshops, webinars and events on site.

“We are devoted to providing each and every one of them [olim] with the tools needed to integrate into Israeli society and continue having a significant influence on the successful development of the State of Israel,"" said Nefesh B'Nefesh co-founder and Executive Director, Rabbi Yehoshua Fass.

autospa writes ""A University of Arizona engineering team led by Roger Angel has designed a new type of solar concentrator that uses half the area of solar (PV) cells used by other optical devices and delivers a light output/concentration that is over 1000 times more concentrated before it even hits the cells. This comes as a result of a broader goal to make solar energy cost competitive with fossil fuels (target = 1$/W) without the 'need for government subsidization.'""

As a fraction of revenue, these new renewable resources are subsidized far more than coal and oil (coal being the subsidized material you should consider). It is refreshing to see these renewable power sources nearing an unsubsidized parity with coal. That's far more important than complaining about which one is subsidized more.

That's somewhat of a misnomer. The subsidies are mostly tricks to get the oil industry to invest in areas that are not profitable for them and they wouldn't otherwise be at.

In more plain terms, if the subsidies didn't exist, oil companies would not miss them, they simply would not be doing some of the things they are now at the request of the government. Eliminating those subsidies would have no real noticeable effect on price or profit.

They do? Your right, because they can explore other areas of business and develop techniques to deal with it in the future without a large loss. However, that doesn't mean they would continue to do so if they were removed.

I didn't say there wasn't a benefit for them. I said the benefit wouldn't effect their profit or prices if it was removed. Instead, they would just go back to what's normally profitable until such time prices are high enough for them to get into those areas on their own.

It's difficult to argue though, that the tax payer should subsidize exploratory ventures for companies which make some of the largest profits on the planet. In short, they could afford these ventures on their own with no help from the taxpayer. It is to their benefit to keep the taxpayer addicted to oil as long as possible. About the only karmic result of all this is that the oil industry will eventually have to expand into other energy sources or face extinction.

Most aged cheeses mature over a few months or even a few years. The world's oldest cheese sat for a little longer: more than 3,600 years. German researchers discovered the cheese intact on a mummy buried in a sand dune in China's Taklamakan Desert, according to USA Today.

The cheese, buried with the mummy in an overturned wooden boat wrapped tightly in cowhide, was from an unknown people traveling during the Bronze Age, roughly between 3000 BCE and 450 BCE. The burial conditions created a vacuum-like environment to preserve the cheese—yellow clumps that resembled kefir, a soft cheese made from a combination of milk, yeast and bacteria similar to cottage cheese.

It's unclear why cheese was with the mummy, but researcher Andrej Shevchenko, who led the study, told USA Today it might have been considered the food of the afterlife.

“We not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese, but we also have direct... evidence of ancient technology,” Shevchenko said to USA Today.

A chemist at Germany's Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Shevchenko says his team determined it was cheese, and not butter or milk, by analyzing the proteins in the cheese. The study's results will be published in the “Journal of Archaeological Science.”

No crackers, cured meats or other hors d'oeuvres were found with the mummy.

Hide and display select option based on other select value

I have this form with a few select dropdowns and based on what we select, we display and hide other dropdowns. When I select the value All then the geo select reacts to the selected value, but when I select the value Test the function family select doesn't disappear. Any reason why?
I also need to assign the value of the function family to 0 when the Test is selected. Help would be appreciated. 
The main select:
<select name=""scope"" onchange=""javascript:sync_scope()"">
                            <option value=""1"">All </option>
                            <option value=""10"">Test</option>
                        </select>

Javascript:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" )? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

The HTML
 <select name=""geo"">
    <?php foreach ($geos as $geo) :?>
        <option value=""<?php echo $geo['id'];?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($geo['name']);?></option>
    <?php endforeach;?>
</select>

<select name=""function_family"" id =""function_family"">
<option value=""0"" <?php selected($function_family, 0);?>>All functions</option>
<?php foreach ($functions as $function) :?>
    <option value=""<?php echo $function['id'];?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($function['name']);?></option>
<?php endforeach;?>
</select>

A:

Your if condition is wrong in the second option:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" )? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

should be:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";

Great in theory, we should get our answers soon. Though you got to ask, if it was possible, wouldn't the forerunners still be around if they had a convenient thing to keep them alive from the flood.

Shield Worlds like Onyx were designed to protect the inhabitants within from the Halo Array's firing, and the worlds within the micro-dyson spheres are massive in scope. It's very likely some of the Forerunners survived within. Others within Cryptums likely survived as well, given the Didact and his Cryptum.

Well, according to moderator Tom Cain, that is. But we have to agree it was pretty darn important. Experts in the smart grid industry gathered to talk about the roadblocks and strategies for the smart grid, and how vital it is to get it up and running nationwide as soon as possible. Click through to hear their talk.The panel included some serious players in the industry. From left to right, moderator Tom Cain, Managing Partner of Sail Venture Partners, Mossadiqu Umedaly, Chairman of BC Hydro, Bill Vogel, CEO of Trilliant, Scott MacDonald, Partner of Emerald Technology, and Eric Dresselhuys, VP and Co-founder of Silver Spring Networks.

Debate on whether or not start-ups can work in the smart grid sphere, and the impact of the stimulus package.

The panel noted that utilities are big beasts and you want them to be very prudent and have reliable systems, so they have to know their suppliers will be there for the long term and have integrated systems. Because of this, the start-ups have a hard time selling individual components to utilities. But the thing is, the smart grid is so new that most all the companies in the industry are fairly small start-ups. Larger organizations get more attention because of their perceived stability, but start-ups also need acknowledgment.

There's tremendous room for innovation in this stage, including a huge opportunity for small companies, vevnture capitalists, and everyone else. Innovation is definitely wanted by utilities but the responsibility of providing power is so serious that innovation is taken with trepidation.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

Analyze the validity of the following reasoning without using truth tables

I have to decide whether the following reasoning is valid or not:
$$\{\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)]\;\wedge\;\neg t\}\quad\Rightarrow\quad p.$$
I have no idea how to prove it. I tried different ways but I'm stuck.
For example, I separated it on premises:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
P_1:&\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)] \\
P_2:&\neg t
\end{array}$$
$\neg t$ must be $T$, so $t$ must be $F$. But by replacing its truth value in $P_1$ I can not assure anything of $p$. On the other hand, if I try to reduce the proposition, it does not give me guarantees of anything over $p$.
What demonstration method should be used? And how would you prove it without using truth tables?
Thanks!

A:

You can do this using the'short truth-table method'.
The idea here is that you try to see whether or not the statement can be false, and so, let's see what has to be the case when the statement is false. As such, we'll put $F$ under the main connective:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&F\\
\end{array}
A conditional can only be false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&T&&&&F&F\\
\end{array}
For the conjunction to be true, both conjuncts need to be true:

Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters Close to Call Up?

It was only a matter of time before this topic was addressed by Dale Sveum and the Cubs front office given the roster turnover the last couple of days. Per Sveum it sounds like the organization will get together on Thursday to discuss the possibility of calling up both Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters this month. Sveum was clear in saying that if they did get called up they would play every day, which is awesome to hear. I for one am excited to see what these guys can do at this level, even if it’s only over the last month and a half. The logical time for a call up would be September when the rosters expand, so it’s news that the organization is discussing this now.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

He only uses water-based paints and sells his paintings for around A$300 (US$250).

Patch says the road to becoming a prolific artist is a rough one.

""There is a limit to how long one can paint for, especially on canvas,"" he said on his Web site.

He adds that taking his work seriously helps him from getting too excited.

""I take the performance very seriously. It is entertainment,"" he said on his website. ""Erotic, yes, but non-sexual. It's a gift, it's art.""

A gift! Whatever. I find this one to be annoying in just about every way, but it's expert attention whoring, and I suppose I have fallen for it by making it an IotD.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

Discover how the Walters comes alive at night! Every Thursday from 5-9 p.m., you can wander the galleries, see special exhibitions for FREE, eat in our café and find the perfect gift at the museum store.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!
