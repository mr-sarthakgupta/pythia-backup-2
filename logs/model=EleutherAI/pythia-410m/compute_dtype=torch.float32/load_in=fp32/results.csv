Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?

Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?

Hello.

We are DWG consultants. We are a full service team of skilled engineers, qualified support staff (and some serious Batkid enthusiasts).

We are breaking free from the engineers stereotype. That's right, we pull out our USB drives without removing safely.

Don't react...listen.

Why do we call ourselves consultants? It's simple. An engineer responds to input from the client. But a consultant asks intelligent questions and draws upon a depth of professional experience to make decisions for the client – bringing answers and smart solutions to the table, not more questions.

We're people people. We thrive on communication and interaction, specifically those of the fun(ny) variety.

Theory of relational awesomeness between DWG and client.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

It's simple:love where you work.

We believe a team that has fun together works well together. And a team that works well together produces amazing work.

We foster collaboration and exploration through our use of cutting edge technology. We design using state of the art workstations and software, focused on Revit (and we play a mean game of Minesweeper).

I know, I was just saying that in-case someone wanted to use the uncompressed textures, as VC seems to act weird with them in gta3.img. at grandparents' house for thanksgiving atm, but having played yesterday I saw tons more phone numbers that were either 555 or sloppily smudged over in the east island/downtown area. someone ought to look at the ps2 files and see if they're different

Inadequate

I found other different textures, is not a bug but for a nice look of the game. Later I post some screenshots here.

EDIT:

Here the screenshots, on the Little Havana shop the PC textures is bugged also you can see right through the glass the other side of the street while in PS2 have the boots thing wall. The texture of the shop is: lhgangshop.txd

Hoping Az can help with this also with the Carrnicero Romero too, I have only the fixed texture of it, I need the DFF building model name.

try opening gta3.img with order set to offset then export all the dffs directly above the area with funhiati.txd, then open them one by one in your modelling program/dff viewer of choice. there's not a ton of them, you should find it pretty easily

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

The key word in the constitution is 'unreasonable'. To me, even the active pursuit of a drug user, using in his own home, outside the purview of public safety, is never reasonable. It goes beyond the role of peace officers. At the same time, i feel all drug use laws are on their face unconstitutional. The tenth amendment restricts federal power to those explicitly given in the constitution. All other powers are to be at the state level. If a state want's to make pot illegal, they can.. but it is unconstitutional for the federal government to do so.

Completely agree. As long as we are not directly harming someone else, what we do in the privacy of our own homes should not be allowed to attacked by government agents.

Victimless crimes is an oxymoron. These are laws that take away our freedoms, create criminals out of otherwise decent citizens and make it so that crime pays very well for those on the top of the criminal food chain. Prohibition proved what victimless laws do to enhance major crime elements. Remove the crime and you remove the criminal element and everyone except organized crime is better off.

...seek, and ye shall find;..

So always seek the Truth, not just what you want to believe to be true…

I think the Costitution was developed to protect the masses from intrusive AND abusive government. While it may appear to be a small thing to break in and stop drug dealers from destroying evidence, the bigger picture would be more like what ATF did in Waco Texas or at Ruby ridge. We have these protections for a reason. When we start to let the g-men slowly tighten their grubby hands around our neck when and where will it stop?

It mentions in that ad that this is indeed the story Togashi wrote 10 years ago that never got made, and is the basis for the movie. The characters in there are the Kurta clan, and it basically gives Kurapika's origin story. It'll appear in two issues for a total of 63 pages. It's called the ""Kurapika Memory Arc"" (クラピカ追憶編). Doesn't mention anything about the series restarting.

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

Over my holiday break, I finally had time to finish reading The Women by T. Coraghessen Boyle (the author that brought you The Road to Wellville and The Inner Circle). The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!

Well, according to moderator Tom Cain, that is. But we have to agree it was pretty darn important. Experts in the smart grid industry gathered to talk about the roadblocks and strategies for the smart grid, and how vital it is to get it up and running nationwide as soon as possible. Click through to hear their talk.The panel included some serious players in the industry. From left to right, moderator Tom Cain, Managing Partner of Sail Venture Partners, Mossadiqu Umedaly, Chairman of BC Hydro, Bill Vogel, CEO of Trilliant, Scott MacDonald, Partner of Emerald Technology, and Eric Dresselhuys, VP and Co-founder of Silver Spring Networks.

Debate on whether or not start-ups can work in the smart grid sphere, and the impact of the stimulus package.

The panel noted that utilities are big beasts and you want them to be very prudent and have reliable systems, so they have to know their suppliers will be there for the long term and have integrated systems. Because of this, the start-ups have a hard time selling individual components to utilities. But the thing is, the smart grid is so new that most all the companies in the industry are fairly small start-ups. Larger organizations get more attention because of their perceived stability, but start-ups also need acknowledgment.

There's tremendous room for innovation in this stage, including a huge opportunity for small companies, vevnture capitalists, and everyone else. Innovation is definitely wanted by utilities but the responsibility of providing power is so serious that innovation is taken with trepidation.

This ostentatious patriotic pose is part of the industry’s cynical PR campaign to convince you and me that its assault on our health, water, air, and economic future should be mindlessly saluted, rather than questioned.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

I'm Dreaming of a Wright Christmas

The Women is a work of historical fiction about Frank Lloyd Wright... a seen through the eyes of his wives and mistresses. The book is a juicy, scandalous quick read that shows Wright's genius (and ego) in all of its prickly glory.

I give the book my wholehearted recommendation. If you're looking for some Holiday reading, it's not exactly the feel good book of the year, but totally engaging. One detail in the book that I hadn't known before is how much Wright loved the holidays. Even though he was all about micromanaging how his clients lived in their houses, he couldn't help but deck the halls at Taliesin with boughs of holly and whatever else he felt was appropriate.

It took roughly 12 square feet of gingerbread dough (that’s four large batches) to make all the walls, floors and roof

Over 8 bags of powdered sugar were used to make all the frosting

It took over 40 sleeves of large Smarties which are used to simulate dry stack stone on the building exterior

The river and water fall are made up of three batches of hard candy

The little details are killing me. The Smarties are such beautiful pastel holiday stand-ins for the locally quarried stone that Wright incorporated into the design. The icicles, trees, candy waterfall and cantilevered slabs of ginerbread concrete are beautifully rendered. Melodie, the mastermind behind the gingerbread house, has a degree in landscape management, which she followed up with a stint in culinary school. It's good to know that those two skills can exist in perfect harmony (in Melodie).

Let's hope preservation of this gingerbread house takes less than the 11.4 million dollars (and counting) that the original Fallingwater has needed for restoration. Happy Holidays, everyone!
