Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value.

string to byte[] array

ok i know this has been beat to death but i can't seam to get all the ones on google here or anyplace to work 
i have a string that looks like this
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

i store this string
each digit has a range from 0 to 254 and the string is almost random
i need to convert this to a byte array because of a hardware
change
this is what the hardware is looking for 
hardware.command(DeviceID, byte[]);

i tested the  hardware by doing this
hardware.command(1, new byte[] { 0, 0, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38,",204,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

Pan Gesture in UICollectionViewCell AND UICollectionView

I have a collection view of bars that can slide up and down. Each cell in the collection view is using a UIPanGestureRecognizer to control the blue bar sliding up and down. The collection view does not scroll here.

There is an ""edit mode"" which disables the pan gesture controlling the bars. The hope here is that in ""edit mode"", the collection view can then scroll left and right. 

My attempt at doing this was to disabled the pan gesture in each of the cells. I also tried using the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate methods to try to disable touches and fail the cell's pan gesture in favor of the collection view's pan gesture. It seems that the collection view's pan gesture is not forwarded to any of the cell's gesture delegate calls.
These delegate calls got me the closest (delegate for cell's pan gesture):

  ","Q:

Is it possible to check the condition of a value of an object and JUST return the key?

I have an object of letters and numbers inside of a function. This function takes in an array of numbers and I'm running a for in loop that iterates over the object and checks a condition. If any of the numbers in the array match any of the values in the object, return just the key to that value. 
So If I pass in switcher(['26']), it should return 'a'. Is this possible?
function switcher(x){
const letters = {
  a: '26',

City Regulations on Dumpster Rental

Most cities or municipalities do not have many regulations regarding dumpster rental as long as you keep the dumpster entirely on your own property during the rental period. If you need to place your container on the street in any way, you will likely have to obtain a permit from the appropriate building permit office in your town.

Vacation without baby

I’m leaving Tuesday to Bahamas without our 16 month old and I’m getting such bad guilt. We are gone for 8 days, hubby had to go for work and I decided it would be fun to make it into a trip for us both without baby. Has anyone else gone for that long and that far? Scares me so much that it will be like minimum 13 hours to get home in an emergency. I’m really questioning my decision to go 😫

I haven’t done it yet, but I think what you are feeling is totally normal and nothing to feel guilty about. I don’t think anyone will ever feel comfortable being so far away from their kids no matter how old they get. However, this vacation will be so nice for you and hubby and if your LO is anything like mine...he/she will have a fantastic time with whoever is babysitting.

My husband & I went to Cuba for a week when our kids were 4 & 1 AND we went to Vegas this past summer when our kids were 17, 11, 8 and 11 months.
We also got snowed in at our cottage recently and missed our now 9 year olds birthday! We FaceTimed her 4 times throughout the day and she didn’t even really care lol

I went to ireland without my husband and son this past July. I understand how you’re feeling being soooo far away if anything was to happen. But once you get to the Bahamas (jealous!) you’ll feel so much better. Trust me. I felt better once I was in Ireland it’s just getting there that was difficult and saying goodbye to my husband and son.

but your time will fly by and your baby will do great without you! And before you know it you’ll be back home. Enjoy :)

Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters Close to Call Up?

It was only a matter of time before this topic was addressed by Dale Sveum and the Cubs front office given the roster turnover the last couple of days. Per Sveum it sounds like the organization will get together on Thursday to discuss the possibility of calling up both Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters this month. Sveum was clear in saying that if they did get called up they would play every day, which is awesome to hear. I for one am excited to see what these guys can do at this level, even if it’s only over the last month and a half. The logical time for a call up would be September when the rosters expand, so it’s news that the organization is discussing this now.

No she didn't but she wasn't very memorable as a BB contestant except for original siding with the resident bitch in the house that year - Grace double barrelled something and then crossing over to the other faction the moment she was kicked out - she might have a house romance too I really can't remember. She was Miss Wales in some capacity too before then.

laravel, How to update array in json column?

in my Laravel app, the database has a column named ""mavads"" as :
{
  ""en"": [
    {
      ""need"": ""enn1"",
      ""amount"": ""enm1""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""enn2"",
      ""amount"": ""enm2""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""enn3"",
      ""amount"": ""enm3""
    },
  ],
  ""ru"": [
    {
      ""need"": ""run1"",
      ""amount"": ""rum1""
    },
    {
      ""need"": ""run2"",
      ""amount"": ""rum1""
    },
  ]
}

This is the form that send data as PUT to the controller to update the database:

@foreach($food->mavads['en'] as $m)
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""enneed[]"" value=""{{ $m['need'] }}"">
      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""enamount[]"" value=""{{ $m['amount'] }}"">

      <input type=""text"" class=""input"" name=""ruamount[]"" value=""{{ $m['amount'] }}"">
@endforeach

the Food Model:
  protected $casts = [
   'mavads' => 'array'
  ];

in Controller, I get $request and want to update each { ""need"": ""run2"",""amount"": ""rum1""} of en or ru languages:
    $enmavad = $request->only('enneed', 'enamount');
    $rumavad = $request->only('runeed', 'ruamount');
    $food->mavads = [""en"" => $enmavad, ""ru"" => $rumavad];

but I get the error and no correct update

Many situations exist where signal interference between multiple wireless devices degrades the performance of one or more of the devices, based on signal strengths and/or the physical proximity of the devices.
For example, in the home, signals from a microwave oven, cordless phone, and wireless access point often interfere with each other. Depending on the relative strengths of the signals (i.e., weaker signals introduce less interference) and/or physical separation between the devices (i.e., signals weaken as the distance between the devices increases), the interference results in a slow download, the inability to communicate with a Web server, or a “bad” phone connection (i.e., unable to clearly hear the other party).
In some situations, the interference may be of little consequence, though annoying to most users. However, there are situations, such as those dealing with the wireless communication devices used by public safety personnel, where the interference has potentially problematic consequences, particularly when working in a hazardous environment.
For example, a police officer typically uses a two-way radio for communicating with a dispatcher or other officers on the same digital radio frequency. These digital radio communications are subject to interference by other wireless devices (e.g., cell phones, vehicular subscriber modems, etc.) that operate on nearby spectrum blocks, when the officer is near to these wireless devices. In such a situation, the officer's time-sensitive communications may become unclear, completely garbled, or delayed.

Hello.

We are DWG consultants. We are a full service team of skilled engineers, qualified support staff (and some serious Batkid enthusiasts).

We are breaking free from the engineers stereotype. That's right, we pull out our USB drives without removing safely.

Don't react...listen.

Why do we call ourselves consultants? It's simple. An engineer responds to input from the client. But a consultant asks intelligent questions and draws upon a depth of professional experience to make decisions for the client – bringing answers and smart solutions to the table, not more questions.

We're people people. We thrive on communication and interaction, specifically those of the fun(ny) variety.

Theory of relational awesomeness between DWG and client.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

Our culture

Our culture is our driving force. We foster an environment of intelligence, exploration, wonder and hilarity. Technology and camaraderie are common themes in our offices.

It's simple:love where you work.

We believe a team that has fun together works well together. And a team that works well together produces amazing work.

We foster collaboration and exploration through our use of cutting edge technology. We design using state of the art workstations and software, focused on Revit (and we play a mean game of Minesweeper).

Let's meet.

Cipières () is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France.

Cipieres is about 50 minutes drive from the French Riviera, and is an unspoilt medieval village of around 500 inhabitants. There are two restaurants, a pizzeria and a general store. Sheep are farmed on the surrounding mountain side and a farm sells lamb direct and also makes a renowned goats cheese. There is an annual free rock festival (Ciprock) as well as a homemade kart race through the narrow streets, attracting children as well as some more serious adults.

It enjoys a beautiful climate and has far reaching views across the valley of the wolf to the peak of Mount Cheiron, with the village of Greolieres in the foreground.

Extending ActiveRecord::Base

I'm trying to add some custom methods to ActiveRecord. I want to add a *_after and *_before scopes for every date field of a model so I can do something like this:
User.created_at_after(DateTime.now - 3.days).created_at_before(DateTime.now)

I've followed the solution explained here Rails extending ActiveRecord::Base but when I execute the rails console and try to call the methods I get an undefined method error.
Here's my code:
# config/initializers/active_record_date_extension.rb
require ""active_record_date_extension""

# lib/active_record_date_extension.rb
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|
      if [""datetime"",""date""].include? column.type
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} >?"", date)
        end
        base.define_method(""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} <?"", date)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
Rails.application.eager_load!

ActiveRecord::Base.descendants.each do |model|
  model.send(:include, ActiveRecordDateExtension)
end

What am I doing wrong?

A:

Using Rails 4.1.9 and Ruby 2.2.1, I noticed a few issues with the code above.

You are comparing column.type with strings, and Rails returns symbols for that attribute.
base.define_method is trying to call a private method, you can get around that with send

This is the tweaked code
module ActiveRecordDateExtension
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do |base|
    base.columns_hash.each do |column_name,column|      
      if [:datetime, :date].include? column.type              
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_after"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} >?"", date)
        end
        base.class.send(:define_method, ""#{column_name}_before"") do |date|
          where(""#{column_name} <?"", date)

Statistics from Altmetric.com

I have worked in Australian urban, suburban and country general practices for more than four decades, and spent about 8 weeks a year for the past 20 years working in remote clinics. These ‘outback’ postings have been predominantly in Aboriginal communities, while in 2008 I worked in Torres Strait on behalf of the Department of Customs, charged with medical assessment and initial treatment of illegal fisherman captured in Australian waters. In 2009, I worked for a time in Alice Springs Correctional Centre, and in 2010 in an Australian Government Immigration Detention Centre offshore.

I therefore read with interest (and admiration) the paper titled ‘Are health professionals working in Australia's immigration detention centres condoning torture?’ in this issue. The paper addresses a number of important issues and questions. In this short commentary I will draw on my personal experience to clarify in which ways, if any, the detained patient might differ from the generality of patients, and hence to identify any distinct ethical duty of the clinician towards them. I outline my personal response to the suggestion that a doctor or a nurse should positively refuse to serve in an immigration detention facility on the grounds that to do so would be to condone or facilitate torture.

Are detained patients different from other patients?

Perhaps the essential difference of an involuntarily detained patient from other patients is in relation to their clinical attendants: their would-be helpers are, inescapably, also their captors.

My detained refuge-seeking patients resembled all patients in that they were variously unhappy and anxious; their understanding of their condition was inadequate; and they were sometimes unwell, although not in the way they understood themselves to be.

These were patients (although my employers insisted they were ‘clients’); however, their complaint, their pathos, was the detained condition, to which more familiar clinical entities were superadded.

With an overall measurement of 17"" x 17"" x 7"", it will require a minimum-width cabinet of 18"". The 726-C, single-handle, vessel faucet offers tall contemporary styling at a 12 1/4"" height, and the longest available spout at a 5"" reach.

                              DECISION ON JOINT STIPULATION1

Dorsey, Chief Special Master:

        On February 22, 2016, Scott Kashkin (“petitioner”) filed a petition for
compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C.
§300aa-10, et seq.,2 (the “Vaccine Act”). Petitioner alleges that he suffered an injury to
his left shoulder as a consequence of an influenza (“flu”) vaccine he received on
September 30, 2014. Petition at 1, 3; Stipulation, filed August 7, 2017, at ¶ 4.
Petitioner further alleges that he suffered the residual effects of this injury for more than
six months. Petition at 4; Stipulation at ¶ 4. “Respondent denies that the flu vaccine
caused petitioner’s alleged left shoulder pain, or any other injury, and further denies that
his current disabilities are a sequela of a vaccine-related injury.” Stipulation at ¶ 6.

       Nevertheless, on August 7, 2017, the parties filed the attached joint stipulation,
stating that a decision should be entered awarding compensation. The undersigned

1
  Because this unpublished decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, the
undersigned intends to post it on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website, in accordance with
the E-Government Act of 2002. 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note (2012) (Federal Management and Promotion of
Electronic Government Services). In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days to
identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, the undersigned agrees that the identified material fits
within this definition, the undersigned will redact such material from public access.

I’m so excited to say that RENEGADE has gotten it’s first blurb! If you follow me on Twitter, then you may remember me tweeting something a week or so ago about waking up in the middle of the night, reading an email and being so excited about it I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

Yeah, it was about this blurb, which is by the absolutely fantastic Ann Aguirre!

I absolutely adore Ann! And not just because of the blurb. I knew I wanted her to blurb my book since I read ENCLAVE (which is absolutely fantastic. You should read it, if you haven’t). I’m even lucky enough to be on a panel with her at RT and I can’t wait to meet her in person! The best part? SHE asked ME if she could read it for a possible blurb and, of course, I agreed to send it to her!

On top of the rest of the books in the Razorland trilogy, Ann also just sold another YA series (a paranormal, named the Beauty series) and I canNOT wait to read them. They sound fantastic.

ENCLAVE is be her first YA series, but she’s a national best-selling author of several adult science fiction books!

Anyway, because of the momentous occasion this is (at least to me), I’m going to be doing a giveaway! I’m going to giveaway a copy of ENCLAVE so you can see for yourself how awesome she is.

All you have to do is enter through the widget below. There’s no mandatory entries, but there’s a few optional options for extra entries (see widget for details).

And, Ann, if you happen to be reading this, THANK YOU SO MUCH! Again. 🙂

Activate/Deactivate multiple clients in Laravel

I am using Laravel 5.1
I have a client table. Client will create their own account and waiting for admin approval. Admin can activate, deactivate or block them anytime. I have three links (I can change to button if needed) bottom of the table ACTIVE, DEACTIVATE & BLOCK. There is also checkbox in every row.
Now, I want select one or multiple clients and change the value of the status field of member table in database.
Here is code of my view:
<table border=""1"">

        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Activity</td>
        <td>main Activity</td>

How to stream DTMF tones through my HEADPHONES?

kind of new to android. I have an app up and running, I am producing DTMF signals and interpreting what is generated with a micro controller. I am successfully generating the tones, but the tones are being played through the speaker and I want to play the tones through a spliced headphone jack (so even after the solution, I need to override android's desire to switch to the speaker when it thinks no headphones are there). Thanks in advance. The code is here..

It may be the beginning of the era of filing paperless returns - anytime and from any place. No longer is there a need to stand in long queues. Filing returns may become an easy and simple exercise. July 31 is the last date for filing income tax returns for individuals, Hindu Undivided Families, and other non-corporate assessees. Taxpayers have started preparing themselves for the yearly ritual of poring over their documents and making hurried calls to their chartered accountants. Though e-filing of returns is not compulsory for individual taxpayers, it has picked up in a big way because of the convenience it offers.

Never ask a man his wage and a woman her age is an adage often quoted but not one that your taxman upholds. Yet again, it's that time of the year when you are required to disclose the details of your income and file income-tax returns. To make this pocket-pinching process a non-taxing job, SundayET lists down six steps which you can follow to sail through. Do you need to pay tax? This year, the income-tax department has made revisions with regard to tax slabs and exemptions.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

The key word in the constitution is 'unreasonable'. To me, even the active pursuit of a drug user, using in his own home, outside the purview of public safety, is never reasonable. It goes beyond the role of peace officers. At the same time, i feel all drug use laws are on their face unconstitutional. The tenth amendment restricts federal power to those explicitly given in the constitution. All other powers are to be at the state level. If a state want's to make pot illegal, they can.. but it is unconstitutional for the federal government to do so.

Completely agree. As long as we are not directly harming someone else, what we do in the privacy of our own homes should not be allowed to attacked by government agents.

Victimless crimes is an oxymoron. These are laws that take away our freedoms, create criminals out of otherwise decent citizens and make it so that crime pays very well for those on the top of the criminal food chain. Prohibition proved what victimless laws do to enhance major crime elements. Remove the crime and you remove the criminal element and everyone except organized crime is better off.

...seek, and ye shall find;..

So always seek the Truth, not just what you want to believe to be true…

I think the Costitution was developed to protect the masses from intrusive AND abusive government.

Search and rescue crews converge on the Grand Mesa, Saturday morning, but not because anyone was in danger or need of rescue, instead it was training for such instances.

They hike, ride, dive, and risk their own lives to save those in danger. Search and Rescue members say that one of the toughest parts of the job is the lack of predictability as each situation presents completely different obstacles.

Lieutenant Jim Fogg with the Mesa County Rural Area Program says ""You can have a situation that seems simple but it turns out to be complex or you can have a complex situation that turns out to be simple.""

So Search and Rescue team members must be prepared and trained for the many problems and obstacles at all times. The team members are training to respond to five different intensive scenarios, including a downed aircraft, a lost snow shoer, an avalanche, a water rescue, and an injured ice climber.

Still, no matter how rugged, cold, or wet the terrain, these men and women are dedicated to saving the lives of others at all costs.

Theodore is located on the Dawson River 105 kilometres south west of Biloela.

From its earliest days, Theodore was a stopping point for travellers and the same is true today.

A pretty place, Theodore is shaped like a point between the Dawson River and Castle Creek, its palm lined streets give a tropical feel to the place. Hewitt Park surrounds the water tower and is a great spot for a picnic lunch or if you’d prefer a river view, Rotary Park in 5th Avenue overlooks Castle Creek.

In the past, the semiconductor industry utilized various methods and structures to form semiconductor devices that had programmable functionality. In some cases, it was desirable to be able to program the functionality after the semiconductor device was assembled into a semiconductor package. The prior methods of programming functionality into a packaged semiconductor device generally required dedicating one or more pins or terminals of the package and the corresponding inputs of the semiconductor device to be used for the programming. Using package pins and semiconductor device inputs required that the semiconductor device and the package have additional inputs thereby increasing the cost of the programmable semiconductor device.
Additionally, once the functionality was programmed into the semiconductor device, it was possible that a malfunction could cause the programming information to be changed. As a result, the semiconductor device could operate with undesired functionality.
Accordingly, it is desirable to have a programmable semiconductor device that minimizes the number of pins utilized for programming the device, that minimizes the impact of changes in the programmed information, and that has a low cost.
For simplicity and clarity of the illustration, elements in the figures are not necessarily to scale, and the same reference numbers in different figures denote the same elements.

As used herein current carrying electrode means an element of a device that carries current through the device such as a source or a drain of an MOS transistor or an emitter or a collector of a bipolar transistor or a cathode or anode of a diode, and a control electrode means an element of the device that controls current through the device such as a gate of an MOS transistor or a base of a bipolar transistor. Although the devices are explained herein as certain N-channel or P-Channel devices, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that complementary devices are also possible in accordance with the present invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the words during, while, and when as used herein are not exact terms that mean an action takes place instantly upon an initiating action but that there may be some small but reasonable delay, such as a propagation delay, between the reaction that is initiated by the initial action.",512,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

It mentions in that ad that this is indeed the story Togashi wrote 10 years ago that never got made, and is the basis for the movie. The characters in there are the Kurta clan, and it basically gives Kurapika's origin story. It'll appear in two issues for a total of 63 pages. It's called the ""Kurapika Memory Arc"" (クラピカ追憶編). Doesn't mention anything about the series restarting.

","Q:

SQLAlchemy + MYSQL unique string column gets truncated

I would like to enforce the uniqueness of a column, but after I add an object to the database the string in this unique column gets cutoff. I have a model defined as follows:
class Topic(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'topic'
    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    slug = Column(String(256), nullable=False, unique=True)
    name = Column(String(256))

Im using SQLAlchemy and MYSQL. When I inspect the table that gets created:
mysql> DESCRIBE topic;
+----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field    | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id       | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| slug     | varchar(10)  | NO   | UNI | NULL    |                |
| name     | varchar(256) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |

How do I get the slug column to have type varchar(256) and Key UNI?

A:

SQLAlchemy doesn't support database migrations. For that, you'd need something like Alembic, which is authored by the same person who wrote SQLAlchemy.
Alternatively, you can issue a DDL statement directly on the MySQL server, and change the Table Definition in Python.
[on mysql]
ALTER TABLE topic MODIFY COLUMN slug VARCHAR(256);

[on python]
class Topic(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'topic'
    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    slug = Column(String(256), nullable=False, unique=True)
    name = Column(String(256))

Aliya organization Nefesh B'Nefesh (NBN) officially opened the doors to its new Tel Aviv office on Monday, with an inauguration ceremony attended by the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv Yisrael Meir Lau.

The rabbi affixed a mezuza on the doorpost of the new office, located in the heart of Israel's cultural capital, on Rothschild Blvd.

NBN said it established its new Aliya center in response to a growing number of olim residing in the greater Tel Aviv area.

NBN's headquarters are in Jerusalem, and the organization also operates offices in Beersheba and Karmiel in addition to the NBN-Friends of the IDF Center for Lone Soldiers, which is also in Tel Aviv.

The new office will provide a wide range of aAliya services, as well as offering olim the opportunity to participate in hundreds of workshops, webinars and events on site.

“We are devoted to providing each and every one of them [olim] with the tools needed to integrate into Israeli society and continue having a significant influence on the successful development of the State of Israel,"" said Nefesh B'Nefesh co-founder and Executive Director, Rabbi Yehoshua Fass.

autospa writes ""A University of Arizona engineering team led by Roger Angel has designed a new type of solar concentrator that uses half the area of solar (PV) cells used by other optical devices and delivers a light output/concentration that is over 1000 times more concentrated before it even hits the cells. This comes as a result of a broader goal to make solar energy cost competitive with fossil fuels (target = 1$/W) without the 'need for government subsidization.'""

As a fraction of revenue, these new renewable resources are subsidized far more than coal and oil (coal being the subsidized material you should consider). It is refreshing to see these renewable power sources nearing an unsubsidized parity with coal. That's far more important than complaining about which one is subsidized more.

That's somewhat of a misnomer. The subsidies are mostly tricks to get the oil industry to invest in areas that are not profitable for them and they wouldn't otherwise be at.

In more plain terms, if the subsidies didn't exist, oil companies would not miss them, they simply would not be doing some of the things they are now at the request of the government. Eliminating those subsidies would have no real noticeable effect on price or profit.

They do? Your right, because they can explore other areas of business and develop techniques to deal with it in the future without a large loss. However, that doesn't mean they would continue to do so if they were removed.

I didn't say there wasn't a benefit for them. I said the benefit wouldn't effect their profit or prices if it was removed. Instead, they would just go back to what's normally profitable until such time prices are high enough for them to get into those areas on their own.

It's difficult to argue though, that the tax payer should subsidize exploratory ventures for companies which make some of the largest profits on the planet. In short, they could afford these ventures on their own with no help from the taxpayer. It is to their benefit to keep the taxpayer addicted to oil as long as possible. About the only karmic result of all this is that the oil industry will eventually have to expand into other energy sources or face extinction.

Most aged cheeses mature over a few months or even a few years. The world's oldest cheese sat for a little longer: more than 3,600 years. German researchers discovered the cheese intact on a mummy buried in a sand dune in China's Taklamakan Desert, according to USA Today.

The cheese, buried with the mummy in an overturned wooden boat wrapped tightly in cowhide, was from an unknown people traveling during the Bronze Age, roughly between 3000 BCE and 450 BCE. The burial conditions created a vacuum-like environment to preserve the cheese—yellow clumps that resembled kefir, a soft cheese made from a combination of milk, yeast and bacteria similar to cottage cheese.

It's unclear why cheese was with the mummy, but researcher Andrej Shevchenko, who led the study, told USA Today it might have been considered the food of the afterlife.

“We not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese, but we also have direct... evidence of ancient technology,” Shevchenko said to USA Today.

A chemist at Germany's Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Shevchenko says his team determined it was cheese, and not butter or milk, by analyzing the proteins in the cheese. The study's results will be published in the “Journal of Archaeological Science.”

No crackers, cured meats or other hors d'oeuvres were found with the mummy.

Fulham striker Vincenzo Montella’s agent has confirmed the player will return to Roma when his loan period expires this summer.

Montella joined the Premiership club on loan in January and has scored four goals already for Chris Coleman’s team, but the prospects of a permanent move are remote as Fulham cannot afford the Italian’s wages.

$\sum_{n \geq 1} |c_n|^2 \leq \frac {1}{8}$

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a $2\pi$ -periodic Riemann integrable function such that $1 \leq f(x) \leq 2$ for all $ x \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $f(x)$ ~ $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{inx}$ be the Fourier expansion of $f$. Prove that:
A) $\sum_{n \geq 1} |c_n|^2 \leq \frac {1}{8}$
B) There exists a continuous $2\pi$-periodic function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with Fourier expansion $g(x)$ ~ $\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac {|c_n|}{n} \cos {nx}$.
I know that the Fourier coefficients are defined as $c_n=\frac {1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)e^{-inx}dx$. I am also familiar with the Dirichlet kernel as an alternate way of finding partial sums. This is a test review problem so a full solution would be appreciated. 

A:

For A), notice that $f(x) - c_0 \sim \sum_{n \neq 0} c_n e^{inx}$. Then by the Parseval's identity and the identity $c_{-n} = \overline{c_n}$, we have
$$ 2 \sum_{n \geq 1} |c_n|^2 = \sum_{n \neq 0} |c_n|^2 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x) - c_0|^2 \, dx. $$
So it suffices to show that the LHS is $\leq \frac{1}{4}$. To this end, we write
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x) - c_0|^2 \, dx
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left(\left(f(x) - \tfrac{3}{2}\right) - \left(c_0 - \tfrac{3}{2}\right) \right)^2 \, dx \\

Skunk tests positive for rabies in West Plano

Plano animal control workers are warning residents to be careful around wild animals after a skunk tested positive for rabies in the area of West Parker Road and Midway Road.

The test was given after the skunk came in contact with a pet in the area. The pet had its rabies shots, but still must be placed in isolation for 45 days to make sure that it hasn’t contracted the virus. City officials said the isolation would have been longer if the pet hadn’t been immunized.

“This positive test highlights the importance of keeping all vaccinations current — especially rabies — since there is no way to predict when a pet may come into contact with a wild animal,” said Jamey Cantrell, animal services manager.

Pets can receive their rabies shots at a low-cost vaccination clinic hosted by the Plano Animal Shelter, 4028 West Plano Parkway, on the third Friday of every month.

[zzzz] capture me
[zzzz] end-pattern

OR could be

Karunaratne made his first class debut for Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in 2008, but had a quiet first season, batting largely in the middle order.

He secured a place in the top order in 2009, and began to score more consistently thereafter. His maiden first-class century, against Colts Cricket Club, heralded a deluge of 1186 runs in the season, at an average of 56.54. His prolific form earnt him a call-up for the Sri Lanka A team against visiting South Africa A, where he again impressed, making 184 against an attack that included Vernon Philander.

Karunaratne has not reproduced the same volume of runs since his second season, but has developed a reputation for making big centuries against good attacks. He played two ODIs for Sri Lanka in 2011, making 4 and 60, and was also included in the Test tour to South Africa later in the year, though he did not get a game.

He toured South Africa again in July 2012 though, with the A team, and impressed with scores of 83 and 150 not out on that tour. Soon after that, he found himself on the verge of a Test debut when he was chosen to open alongside SSC partner Tharanga Paranavitana, replacing the injured Tillakaratne Dilshan for the Test against New Zealand in Galle.Andrew Fernando

Hide and display select option based on other select value

I have this form with a few select dropdowns and based on what we select, we display and hide other dropdowns. When I select the value All then the geo select reacts to the selected value, but when I select the value Test the function family select doesn't disappear. Any reason why?
I also need to assign the value of the function family to 0 when the Test is selected. Help would be appreciated. 
The main select:
<select name=""scope"" onchange=""javascript:sync_scope()"">
                            <option value=""1"">All </option>
                            <option value=""10"">Test</option>
                        </select>

Javascript:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" )? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

The HTML
 <select name=""geo"">
    <?php foreach ($geos as $geo) :?>
        <option value=""<?php echo $geo['id'];?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($geo['name']);?></option>
    <?php endforeach;?>
</select>

<select name=""function_family"" id =""function_family"">
<option value=""0"" <?php selected($function_family, 0);?>>All functions</option>
<?php foreach ($functions as $function) :?>
    <option value=""<?php echo $function['id'];?>""><?php echo utf8_encode($function['name']);?></option>
<?php endforeach;?>
</select>

A:

Your if condition is wrong in the second option:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";     
      document.form.function_family.style.display = ( scope == ""10"" )? ""none"" : ""block"";

    }

should be:
 function sync_scope() {
      var scope = document.form.scope.value;
      document.form.geo.style.display = ( scope == ""1"" )? ""block"" : ""none"";

In the main square, Piața Unirii, and the general downtown area, covrigarii abound. They are pretzel shops that consist of one employee behind a walk-up window selling fresh-baked pretzels.

The pretzels are covered in poppy seeds on at least one side and come strung on a wire depending on how many the customer orders (whether it's a meal or not also depends on how many the customer orders). They cost 1 leu each, about US$0.30 and are eaten morning, noon, and night by whoever happens to walk past. Some shops look more locally owned than others — there are definitely some chain covrigarii but all the pretzels look the same and are similarly priced.

Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to eat any covrigi because I live gluten-free, but the smells that come out of each window are incredible and always make me consider having a gluten day.

Bartlett police have arrested and charged four juveniles with residential burglary. Police responded at about 1:50 p.m. Sept. 3 to the scene of a burglary at a single-family home in the 1100 block of Virginia Court. The homeowner reported someone stole several video game items, clothing, and jewelry after gaining entry through the back door of the home when the family was out of town during the weekend before. The police investigation led to the arrest of four 14-year-old males who were charged with burglary and were petitioned to the DuPage County Juvenile Court.

Shield Worlds like Onyx were designed to protect the inhabitants within from the Halo Array's firing, and the worlds within the micro-dyson spheres are massive in scope. It's very likely some of the Forerunners survived within. Others within Cryptums likely survived as well, given the Didact and his Cryptum.

Well, according to moderator Tom Cain, that is. But we have to agree it was pretty darn important. Experts in the smart grid industry gathered to talk about the roadblocks and strategies for the smart grid, and how vital it is to get it up and running nationwide as soon as possible. Click through to hear their talk.The panel included some serious players in the industry. From left to right, moderator Tom Cain, Managing Partner of Sail Venture Partners, Mossadiqu Umedaly, Chairman of BC Hydro, Bill Vogel, CEO of Trilliant, Scott MacDonald, Partner of Emerald Technology, and Eric Dresselhuys, VP and Co-founder of Silver Spring Networks.

Debate on whether or not start-ups can work in the smart grid sphere, and the impact of the stimulus package.

The panel noted that utilities are big beasts and you want them to be very prudent and have reliable systems, so they have to know their suppliers will be there for the long term and have integrated systems. Because of this, the start-ups have a hard time selling individual components to utilities. But the thing is, the smart grid is so new that most all the companies in the industry are fairly small start-ups. Larger organizations get more attention because of their perceived stability, but start-ups also need acknowledgment.

There's tremendous room for innovation in this stage, including a huge opportunity for small companies, vevnture capitalists, and everyone else. Innovation is definitely wanted by utilities but the responsibility of providing power is so serious that innovation is taken with trepidation.

This ostentatious patriotic pose is part of the industry’s cynical PR campaign to convince you and me that its assault on our health, water, air, and economic future should be mindlessly saluted, rather than questioned.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

Analyze the validity of the following reasoning without using truth tables

I have to decide whether the following reasoning is valid or not:
$$\{\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)]\;\wedge\;\neg t\}\quad\Rightarrow\quad p.$$
I have no idea how to prove it. I tried different ways but I'm stuck.
For example, I separated it on premises:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
P_1:&\neg p\Rightarrow [(\neg s\Rightarrow \neg r)\;\wedge\;(\neg s\vee t)] \\
P_2:&\neg t
\end{array}$$
$\neg t$ must be $T$, so $t$ must be $F$. But by replacing its truth value in $P_1$ I can not assure anything of $p$. On the other hand, if I try to reduce the proposition, it does not give me guarantees of anything over $p$.
What demonstration method should be used? And how would you prove it without using truth tables?
Thanks!

A:

You can do this using the'short truth-table method'.
The idea here is that you try to see whether or not the statement can be false, and so, let's see what has to be the case when the statement is false. As such, we'll put $F$ under the main connective:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&F\\
\end{array}
A conditional can only be false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land&\neg &t&\}&\rightarrow &p\\
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&T&&&&F&F\\
\end{array}
For the conjunction to be true, both conjuncts need to be true:
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccc}
\{&\neg &p &\rightarrow &[(&\neg &s & \rightarrow &\neg &r&)&\land&(&\neg &s&\lor &t&)]&\land",512,51,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters Close to Call Up?

It was only a matter of time before this topic was addressed by Dale Sveum and the Cubs front office given the roster turnover the last couple of days. Per Sveum it sounds like the organization will get together on Thursday to discuss the possibility of calling up both Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters this month. Sveum was clear in saying that if they did get called up they would play every day, which is awesome to hear. I for one am excited to see what these guys can do at this level, even if it’s only over the last month and a half. The logical time for a call up would be September when the rosters expand, so it’s news that the organization is discussing this now.

Many situations exist where signal interference between multiple wireless devices degrades the performance of one or more of the devices, based on signal strengths and/or the physical proximity of the devices.
For example, in the home, signals from a microwave oven, cordless phone, and wireless access point often interfere with each other. Depending on the relative strengths of the signals (i.e., weaker signals introduce less interference) and/or physical separation between the devices (i.e., signals weaken as the distance between the devices increases), the interference results in a slow download, the inability to communicate with a Web server, or a “bad” phone connection (i.e., unable to clearly hear the other party).
In some situations, the interference may be of little consequence, though annoying to most users. However, there are situations, such as those dealing with the wireless communication devices used by public safety personnel, where the interference has potentially problematic consequences, particularly when working in a hazardous environment.
For example, a police officer typically uses a two-way radio for communicating with a dispatcher or other officers on the same digital radio frequency. These digital radio communications are subject to interference by other wireless devices (e.g., cell phones, vehicular subscriber modems, etc.) that operate on nearby spectrum blocks, when the officer is near to these wireless devices. In such a situation, the officer's time-sensitive communications may become unclear, completely garbled, or delayed.
Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.

Bethel’s congregation moved from Grand Rapids, at 834 Lake Dr. SE, into the space last year.

Renovation

The renovation project involves transforming the former grocery space into a church, with worship spaces, offices and classrooms for Sunday school and youth groups.

The renovation work will happen in two phases, said Dulane Coval, Wolverine Builiding Group project manager.

The first phase will focus on developing the sanctuary and classrooms, while the second phase will focus on the stage area and other finishing touches.

The first phase should be completed in about a month, and the second phase should be completed in early May, assuming Bethel’s $200,000 fundraising campaign is successful, Coval said.

“What they’re trying to do is take a grocery store and make it into space usable for a church,” Coval said. “Right now, we’ve got plastic all over the place, trying to control dust. But they are in there using it.

“They have a long-range vision, but no timeline has been put to that, because they don’t know where they money is coming from yet.”

Youth expansion

One of the main reasons for the expansion is to expand Bethel’s programs for children and youth groups with a new Children’s Center, said Jathan Austin, Bethel’s lead pastor.

“We decided as a congregation to impact the community of Grandville and Grand Rapids by first investing in our children,” Austin said.

Austin said, for example, that the church offers a Believe to Become program, which promotes educational and parental excellence.

“We are in the people business,” Austin said. “If we fail the people, we have failed as a church.”

Abney name

Austin is the grandson of the one of the church’s founders, the late Bishop William Abney, who the city of Grand Rapids honored by naming Abney Avenue after him in 1995, according to the church website.

Bethel has plans to honor Abney’s lifelong passion for the arts by including in their new facility a “top-notch” auditorium named in Bishop Abney’s honor.

                              DECISION ON JOINT STIPULATION1

Dorsey, Chief Special Master:

        On February 22, 2016, Scott Kashkin (“petitioner”) filed a petition for
compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C.
§300aa-10, et seq.,2 (the “Vaccine Act”). Petitioner alleges that he suffered an injury to
his left shoulder as a consequence of an influenza (“flu”) vaccine he received on
September 30, 2014. Petition at 1, 3; Stipulation, filed August 7, 2017, at ¶ 4.
Petitioner further alleges that he suffered the residual effects of this injury for more than
six months. Petition at 4; Stipulation at ¶ 4. “Respondent denies that the flu vaccine
caused petitioner’s alleged left shoulder pain, or any other injury, and further denies that
his current disabilities are a sequela of a vaccine-related injury.” Stipulation at ¶ 6.

       Nevertheless, on August 7, 2017, the parties filed the attached joint stipulation,
stating that a decision should be entered awarding compensation. The undersigned

1
  Because this unpublished decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, the
undersigned intends to post it on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website, in accordance with
the E-Government Act of 2002. 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note (2012) (Federal Management and Promotion of
Electronic Government Services). In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days to
identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, the undersigned agrees that the identified material fits
within this definition, the undersigned will redact such material from public access.

add different text under each image in inline list with link

As I said in the title I need to add a different text under each image
these images are contained in a list and displayed as inline
and connected to a link.
so I need to keep both image and text connected to the same link.
I tried this method but the images appear in the form of a vertical list.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

Aliya organization Nefesh B'Nefesh (NBN) officially opened the doors to its new Tel Aviv office on Monday, with an inauguration ceremony attended by the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv Yisrael Meir Lau.

The rabbi affixed a mezuza on the doorpost of the new office, located in the heart of Israel's cultural capital, on Rothschild Blvd.

NBN said it established its new Aliya center in response to a growing number of olim residing in the greater Tel Aviv area.

NBN's headquarters are in Jerusalem, and the organization also operates offices in Beersheba and Karmiel in addition to the NBN-Friends of the IDF Center for Lone Soldiers, which is also in Tel Aviv.

The new office will provide a wide range of aAliya services, as well as offering olim the opportunity to participate in hundreds of workshops, webinars and events on site.

“We are devoted to providing each and every one of them [olim] with the tools needed to integrate into Israeli society and continue having a significant influence on the successful development of the State of Israel,"" said Nefesh B'Nefesh co-founder and Executive Director, Rabbi Yehoshua Fass.

Most aged cheeses mature over a few months or even a few years. The world's oldest cheese sat for a little longer: more than 3,600 years. German researchers discovered the cheese intact on a mummy buried in a sand dune in China's Taklamakan Desert, according to USA Today.

The cheese, buried with the mummy in an overturned wooden boat wrapped tightly in cowhide, was from an unknown people traveling during the Bronze Age, roughly between 3000 BCE and 450 BCE. The burial conditions created a vacuum-like environment to preserve the cheese—yellow clumps that resembled kefir, a soft cheese made from a combination of milk, yeast and bacteria similar to cottage cheese.

It's unclear why cheese was with the mummy, but researcher Andrej Shevchenko, who led the study, told USA Today it might have been considered the food of the afterlife.

“We not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese, but we also have direct... evidence of ancient technology,” Shevchenko said to USA Today.

A chemist at Germany's Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Shevchenko says his team determined it was cheese, and not butter or milk, by analyzing the proteins in the cheese. The study's results will be published in the “Journal of Archaeological Science.”

No crackers, cured meats or other hors d'oeuvres were found with the mummy.

The Cellar is the original coffeeshop with no coffee and no shop. Founded in 1990, The Cellar is one of the oldest communities on the net. Join us at the table if you like!

He only uses water-based paints and sells his paintings for around A$300 (US$250).

Patch says the road to becoming a prolific artist is a rough one.

""There is a limit to how long one can paint for, especially on canvas,"" he said on his Web site.

He adds that taking his work seriously helps him from getting too excited.

""I take the performance very seriously. It is entertainment,"" he said on his website. ""Erotic, yes, but non-sexual. It's a gift, it's art.""

A gift! Whatever. I find this one to be annoying in just about every way, but it's expert attention whoring, and I suppose I have fallen for it by making it an IotD.

What I do with my own unit, I also consider to be art. It's just not for public display.chrisinhouston Sunday Jul 30 09:54 AM

This ostentatious patriotic pose is part of the industry’s cynical PR campaign to convince you and me that its assault on our health, water, air, and economic future should be mindlessly saluted, rather than questioned.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can you see through the frackers’ big lie”?

Far from independence, we’re going to get the pollution — while foreigners take the energy. The gas extracted from our fractured land is destined for export. How do we know that?

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!

National radio commentator, writer, public speaker, and author of the book, Swim Against The Current: Even A Dead Fish Can Go With The Flow, Jim Hightower has spent three decades battling the Powers That Be on behalf of the Powers That Ought To Be - consumers, working families, environmentalists, small businesses, and just-plain-folks.

In shale fields across the country, you’ll see fracking rigs festooned with Old Glory, and they even paint some of their rigs red, white, and blue.

This ostentatious patriotic pose is part of the industry’s cynical PR campaign to convince you and me that its assault on our health, water, air, and economic future should be mindlessly saluted, rather than questioned.

“Energy Independence! ” is their deafening cry. The so-called shale gas boom, they proclaim, will free America from dependence on foreign producers.

This Fourth of July, can you sing “Oh say can",512,102,"tensor(True, device='cuda:0')",False

Ros from Hampshire

Just off the M4 motorway and two minutes walk from the nearest mainline railway station, the Castle Hotel is the perfect base …More

Got to room was well impressed with the quality of the room and fittings.Excellent room size and the on site restaurant is a must great choice for breakfast which was included in price great value for money and would re-visit again when in area

...no need to have worried! Slept well, breakfast (cooked if wanted) did the job very well, room comfortable and very clean. Excellent position near the M4 and hardly noticed any traffic noise. Well done all!

add different text under each image in inline list with link

Discover how the Walters comes alive at night! Every Thursday from 5-9 p.m., you can wander the galleries, see special exhibitions for FREE, eat in our café and find the perfect gift at the museum store.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, fine book binding enjoyed a golden age of creativity and lavish decoration. These handmade, individual and highly personal objects were made not only to protect the texts they contained, but also to be admired and appreciated as portable decorative masterpieces in their own right.

The Japanese art of flower arranging, or ikebana, has inspired the creation of extraordinary ceramic containers. This exhibition outlines the history of some of Japan’s major schools of ikebana and displays a wide variety of contemporary ceramics created in harmony with the most modern floral conventions.

I think it's a fantastic idea.

I am so EGGXCITED to announce

that each sign is now only

$14.00 per sign,which is a

a huge discount.

If You Do have a Brick and Mortar Shop, and would like to get these signs in your store, or you need eggstra inventory for your craft shows, These signs sell. I can ship lots of signs in a flat rate box to save money, and extra discount off large orders.

Or you can come to my studio near College Station,Tx and pick up your order.

Got them listed on my etsy for sale, but if you would like to order and pay with your credit card, I process with the square card reader.

Email me at susanwymola@gmail.com

and put Buy Signs} in the subject line and I will let you know how you can buy these signs.","I KNOW I could do well selling at wholesale prices to the brick and mortar stores (real retail shops)

but I would have to travel around to find them. So I figured,

why not make them wholesale prices to the public?

Let me Share the fun with YOU, and no middle man involved. I think it's a fantastic idea.

First, because the industry and its government enablers admit it in their internal communications. Second, guess who’s paying for the fracking of America?

Dyer cites reports by Bloomberg news that China has pumped $5.5 billion into the U.S. drilling boom — not only so it can export the energy back to their people, but especially so the Chinese can “redeploy the best U.S. practices and technologies” back to China.

Other foreign investors fracking us hail from Japan ($5 billion invested so far), India ($3.5 billion), France ($4.5 billion), as well as South Korea, the UK, and Norway.

Norway? Come on, America — don’t let the profiteers wrap you up in our own flag. It’s the Fourth of July — let’s rebel!
